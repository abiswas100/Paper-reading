Addressing the Cross-Sensitivity of Magnesium
Zinc Ferrite Towards Reducing Gas Sensing
Using Pattern Recognition Techniques


what it is about?
Pattern Recognition is used to address the cross-sensitivity of nano-crystalline 
magnesium zinc ferrite as combustible gas sensors.

Strategies Used:
* during gas sensing, the natureof the transient resistance response at different operating temperature 
depends on the type of test gas under investigation. 
*  various catalyst semi-conducting oxide combinations have been used to improve the sensitivity of 
    the respective oxide towards speciÔ¨Åc gas
* noise spectroscopy analysis of conductance transient have been adopted to address the selectivity issue.

now the limited success of these Techniques is due to the use of :
* expensive precursor material for sensor synthesis, costly equipment and laboratory procedure 
which is non conductive to yield continuous gas monitoring for any practical application.
