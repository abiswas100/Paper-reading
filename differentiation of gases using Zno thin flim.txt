Qualitative and quantitative differentiation of gases
using ZnO thin film gas sensors and pattern
recognition analysis


what it is about??

Nano-crystalline ZnO thin films were grown using 2 methods
    *metal organic chemical vapor deposition
and the selectivity was tested for 3 gases (hydrogen , Co2,Ch4).

Structural and Micro-Structural characteristics were also invesigated usig 2 methods:
*X ray diffraction
*electron microscopy technique

A dynamic flow gas sensing setup the sensing characteristics were checked for gas concentration of 10-1 ppm at
 250-380 'C.These films worked for all the gases and produced 
,68 59 nd 52 % response respectively.

the data matrices recieved form FFT analysis of the conductance transient were used as input parameters in a linear unsupervised principal component analysis(PCA) pattern recognition technique.

Introduction:
What is cross sentivity??

semiconductor oxides were used because they have excellent sensitivty characteristics but their poor selectivity limits application.

approach of using sensor arrays were attempted instead of single discrete sensor, temperature modulation of the sensing element, use of surface
sensitizers and filters, noise spectroscopy analyses of conductance transients etc.

3 other paper work were studied for this:
*tomchenko et.al - . used a SMO based thick film sensor array in a sensor operating temperature ranging from 200â€“400 *C
*Ramgir et.al - incorporated platinum (Pt) into a SnO2 thin film for selective CO detection
*Ippolito et.al - 5 investigated the catalytic effect of platinum and gold in WO3 thin film sensing elements for selective hydrogen gas sensing performance.
*Gomri et al- utilized noise spectroscopy analysis to address the cross-sensitivity of their sensing elements
